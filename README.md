# Major_Project_Electromagnetic_Fault_Injection_ASCON_using_ChipShouter_Varun_Narayanan
This project is based on hardware security, We implement the ASCON onto a M5STACK ESP32 module which contains a PSRAM. and use the ChipShouter to inject electromagnetic pulses onto the target module to inject faults onto the ASCON algorithm. This will prove that ASCON is vulnerable to EMFI attacks.
